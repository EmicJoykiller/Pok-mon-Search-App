The Pokémon Search App is an interactive, user-centric web application built with modern web technologies. Users can search for Pokémon by name or ID, and the app fetches real-time data from the PokéAPI, providing detailed information about each Pokémon, such as base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed), types, height, weight, and sprite images.

The frontend is built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+), utilizing the power of fetch API for seamless API calls. The app is designed with a focus on accessibility and performance, ensuring fast load times and smooth transitions. The design uses a flexbox layout to ensure responsiveness across mobile and desktop devices, adapting the user interface for optimal viewing experience.

Key features include:

A search form with real-time search capabilities, where users can quickly find the Pokémon they are looking for.
A clean, visually engaging UI enhanced with CSS animations and vibrant colors such as purple, yellow, green, and white for a lively Pokémon theme.
Responsive design ensuring a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices. On desktop, the app features a two-column layout to display search results alongside detailed Pokémon information without the need for scrolling.
Dynamic table presentation of Pokémon base stats, with each Pokémon's type highlighted in different colors, providing a clear and aesthetically pleasing way to visualize the data.
An intuitive UX with clear labeling and easy navigation, enhancing the overall user experience.
The app also ensures cross-browser compatibility, performing consistently across major web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. This project leverages modern JavaScript techniques and clean code practices to deliver a fast, interactive, and delightful Pokémon search experience for all users.
